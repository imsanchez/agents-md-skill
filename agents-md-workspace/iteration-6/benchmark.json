    "Clean fixtures reveal the real gap: with_skill 96.3% vs without_skill 88.9% (+7.4%), up from the misleading +4.2% in iterations 3-5 where contaminated fixtures made evals 1 and 2 non-discriminating.",
    "Eval 0 (new project from scratch) now shows a 22-point gap: with_skill 8/9 (88.9%) vs without_skill 6/9 (66.7%). The new 'under-100-lines' assertion is the biggest discriminator — with_skill produced 60 lines vs without_skill's 138 lines. The 'no-obvious-filler' assertion also discriminates: with_skill omits npm install entirely, without_skill includes it with a standalone code block.",
    "The 'no-obvious-filler' assertion now PASSES for with_skill (first time across all iterations). With clean fixtures, the model no longer copies npm install from a pre-existing AGENTS.md. The skill's instruction to avoid filler is finally working when creating from scratch.",
    "The 'uses-list-format' assertion still fails for with_skill when creating from scratch. The model defaults to ```bash code blocks for commands even though the skill example uses bullet format. This may require explicit instruction in the skill body, not just an example.",
    "Evals 1 and 2 pass 100% for both configs, but with_skill produces notably leaner outputs: eval 1 with_skill is 27 lines vs without_skill 40 lines (the without_skill includes a code snippet example). Eval 2 with_skill is 32 lines vs without_skill 43 lines. Tighter line count assertions (e.g., under-35-lines) could capture this difference.",
    "Token overhead is stable at ~21%, similar to previous iterations. Duration overhead at ~39% is within normal variance."
