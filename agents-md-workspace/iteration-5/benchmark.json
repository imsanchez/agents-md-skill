    "Scores are identical to iterations 3 and 4: with_skill 95.8% vs without_skill 91.7%. The example content change (bun/Express to pnpm/Turborepo) had zero effect on model behavior for the npm-based test fixtures. This confirms the 'no-filler' assertion failure is a model behavior issue, not an example-following issue.",
    "The with_skill eval 0 output is byte-for-byte identical across iterations 3, 4, and 5 (same 70 lines, same npm install on line 29). The model has a strong prior that Setup sections should include install commands regardless of what the skill's example shows.",
    "Eval 1 outputs are now identical between with_skill and without_skill (both 32 lines, same content). The fixture already contains both gotchas from previous iteration runs, making this eval non-discriminating. The fixtures need to be reset to clean state for meaningful comparison.",
    "Eval 2 outputs are also nearly identical between configs — same fixture contamination issue. Both produce the same 39-line auth CLAUDE.md with the same structure and content.",
    "The only consistently discriminating assertion is 'uses-list-format' on eval 0: with_skill uses bullet lists for commands, without_skill uses heading + code block format. This has been stable across all iterations.",
    "Recommendation: To make the 'no-filler' assertion pass, the skill would need to explicitly call out install commands in the writing rules (not just the example). Alternatively, accept that 7/8 on eval 0 is the skill's ceiling for this assertion."
