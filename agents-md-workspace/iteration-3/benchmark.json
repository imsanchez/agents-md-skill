    "With-skill achieves list format for Development/Testing commands (new in this iteration), while baseline still uses code blocks throughout. The 'uses-list-format' assertion now passes for with_skill but fails for baseline — first discriminating result on this assertion.",
    "The 'npm install' in the Setup section still triggers the 'no filler' assertion failure for with_skill. The model treats Setup as a special case where install instructions feel justified. May need stronger language or may be acceptable.",
    "Eval 2 (monorepo) outputs are nearly identical between with_skill and baseline because previous iteration runs modified the fixture files. Both inherited accumulated state. This is a testing artifact, not a meaningful comparison for this iteration.",
    "Eval 1 (update existing) with_skill produced a notably leaner output (32 lines) vs baseline (38 lines). The skill version placed the Redis gotcha inline under the Test heading rather than in a separate Gotchas section with code examples — more contextual and concise.",
    "Token overhead is stable at ~25%, duration overhead improved from iter2 (+8%) to ~44% — variance between runs rather than a trend."
