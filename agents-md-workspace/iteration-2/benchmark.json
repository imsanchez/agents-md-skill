    "New 'uses-list-format' assertion failed for BOTH with_skill and baseline in eval 0. The skill's example uses bullet list format, but the agent still defaulted to ```sh code blocks. The example alone isn't enough to override the model's strong default of using code blocks for commands.",
    "The skill still beats baseline on the 'no filler' assertion (baseline included 'npm install' again).",
    "Token overhead dropped significantly from iteration 1 (+32%) to iteration 2 (+13%), and duration overhead dropped from +88% to +8%. The skill is getting more efficient.",
    "Evals 1 and 2 remain non-discriminating — both versions pass all assertions. The qualitative differences matter more here.",
    "Key qualitative difference in eval 2: the with-skill version added a testing-specific gotcha ('each refresh call consumes the token, so tests must generate fresh tokens per test case') that the baseline missed. This is genuinely useful extra context."
