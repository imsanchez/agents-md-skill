    "The skill achieves 100% pass rate across all 3 evals vs 95.2% for baseline. The baseline failed on the 'no filler' assertion in eval 0 (included 'npm install' instruction).",
    "The with-skill outputs are notably more concise: 65 lines vs 102 for eval 0. The skill's <300 line guidance and 'don't state the obvious' instruction appear to be working.",
    "Eval 1 (update existing) is non-discriminating — both versions passed all assertions. This is expected since the task is fairly constrained and the user provided very specific instructions.",
    "Eval 2 (monorepo) is also non-discriminating on assertions, but qualitative differences exist: the with-skill version (27 lines) includes turborepo filter syntax, while the baseline (22 lines) uses only npm commands.",
    "The skill costs more tokens (~32% more) and takes roughly 2x longer due to reading the skill file and best-practices reference. This overhead is acceptable given the quality improvements, especially for the from-scratch use case.",
    "The most impactful skill guidance appears to be: (1) the 'no filler' instruction preventing boilerplate, (2) the monorepo subdirectory handling, and (3) the WHAT/WHY/HOW framework producing better-organized output."
